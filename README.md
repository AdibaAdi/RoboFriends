# Getting Started with Create React App

RoboFreinds is a react app that I developed using the tutorial as a part of my javascript course from Udemy. This Project was built by using git bash, sublime, react software, and json folders. I slightly modified the project to my own liking. This project reflects on my learning journey of advanced javascript.
