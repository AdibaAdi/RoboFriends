# Building learning project Robofriends using React App

RoboFreinds is a react app that I developed using the tutorial as a part of my javascript course from Udemy. This Project was built by using git bash, sublime, react software, and json folders. I slightly modified the project to my own liking. This project reflects on my learning journey of advanced javascript. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
